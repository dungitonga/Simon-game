# Simon-game

This project replicates the mechanics of a popular game called Simon, which was created by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison under Marvin Glass and Associates, with software developed by Lenny Cope. Simon challenges players' short-term memory by generating sequences of tones and lights that users must replicate. In this adaptation, the same idea is applied using a website featuring buttons, colors, and sounds.
